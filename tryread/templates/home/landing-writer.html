  <h2>Don't let anyone to stay between you and readers.</h2>
  <p class="py-4">There's no reason to let anyone decide whether or when you should publish. There's no reason to let anyone decide if someone can read what you wrote.</p>
  <p>
    Every story has it's readers. Do you have a story you like? Do you like to write? Write the store and publish as soon as you can and share it with as most readers as you can. Are you scared to publish? Why? Because of critics? You should be scared if you told the world you're great at writing and everything you write is Pulitzer Price for sure, but the source of that fear is the lie you told the world not your writing. Don't promiss anything, don't expect anything, tell the truth, just have fun with writing and share the story with others. Do you think you're not good enough yet? So what? The story is the most important thing not your writing skills. You will improve with time faster than you think but you have to share the story with others. People will help you with your writing but you have to give them a chance. I respect every opinion. Opinions can just help me to write better. Any critic can't hurt me because I don't tell anyone I'm good with writing. I have no ambition to become famous writer, I’m just grateful I can write a story and share it. The story is most important, not me. I’m glad the story came to me and I can share it with others. I just try not to break it, not to interrupt readers with reading. If you put it in that way, you won’t find any reason to let anyone decide if you should publish or not. You don't even have to wait with publishing to the end of writing. In fact you shouldn't. Publish your first chapter, share it and ask readers for opinion. Let them help you with the writing. Let them tell you what they like, what you can develop or improve. Don't hide the story. You know how risky it is you will never finish your book without any help or feedback? Do you know how easier writing is when somebody tells you she/he likes it? Do you know how boosting is when people start paying you just for the first 5 or 10 chapters? Let readers help you with the writing. Don’t hide the story. It’s not yours. Yes. The story is not yours. You should just write it. Let it free to the others as soon as possible. The story want to be read by thousands. You doubt? Do you like the story? Do you think it's good, interesting, brings some fun and good emotions? Do you know how many people would think the same? Not many? Why? Do you know how many people read? Do you think there's no one who would think that the story you write is fine? Are you the only one? Please... Don’t think about yourself too much. Think it this way. The story has been given to you not to hide it but to share it. Start to write as good as you can, publish it immidiately and people will help you. We all love to read.
