  <h2>Don't let anyone to stay between you and readers.</h2>
  <p class="py-4">There's no reason to let anyone decide whether or when you should publish. There's no reason to let anyone decide if someone can read what you wrote.</p>
  <p>
    I respect every opinion, specially critics, publishers, pro guys. They can help us write better, but I have no ambition to become famous writer, I’m just grateful I can write a story and share. The story is most important, not me. I’m glad the story came to me and I can share it with other. I just try not to break it, not to interrupt reader with reading. If you put it in that way, you won’t find any reason to let anyone decide for you whether to publish or not. You don't even have to wait with publishing to the end of writing. In fact you shouldn't. Publish your first chapter. Share it. Ask readers for opinion. Let them help you with the writing. Let them tell you what they like, what you can develop or improve. Don't hide the story. You know how risky it is you will never finish your book without any help or feedback? Do you know how easier writing is when somebody tells you she/he likes it? Do you know how boosting is when people start paying you just for the first 5 or 10 chapters? Let readers help you with the writing. Don’t hide the story. It’s not yours. Yes. The story is not yours. You should just write it. Let it free to the others as soon as possible. The story want to be read by thousands. You doubt? Do you like the story? Do you think it's good, interesting, brings some fun and good emotions? Do you know how many people would think the same? Do you doubt? Why? Do you know how many people read? Do you think there's noone who would think that the story you write is fine? Are you the only one? Why are you so different? Please. Don’t think about yourself too much. Think it this way. The story has been given to you not to hide it but to share it. Start to write as good as you can, publish it immidiately and people will help you. We all love to read. Let the story live.
