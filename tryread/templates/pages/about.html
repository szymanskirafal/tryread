    Tryread is not for everyone. It's a place only for those who love books. It is a place for good people only. Tryred lets readers and writers chat with each other but only good vibes are allowed. The books are most importan here because we all love good books and we all are the same with this love. That's kind of Tryread only rule. The rest is because of that. Readers don't have to pay before they read. Readers can pay whatever they want if they like what they read. 98 % of these money goes straight to writers. Readers can discuss with writers. Readers can help other readers to find good book. Writers can publish whatever they want but they can be banned if readers will ask for it because good books are most important here. Writers can ask readers for help with writing because good books are most important here. Writers can publish few chapters only and ask readers for feedback because good books are most importan here.  Writers need to pay just 1 USD a month because Tryread need to pay for servers, security, development but Tryread gives writers back 98 % of what people pay for reading because... good books are most important here. Tryread will add new feauters if readers or writers will want to. Everything here is or will be because we all love good books.
