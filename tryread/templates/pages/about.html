    Tryread is not for everyone. It's a place only for those who love books. It is a place for good people only. The books are most important here because we all love good books and we all are the same with this love. That's kind of Tryread only rule. The rest is because of that. Readers don't have to pay before they read. Readers can pay whatever they want if they like what they read. 98 % of these money goes straight to writers. Writers have to pay just 1 USD a quarter (3 months) because Tryread need to pay for servers, security, development, etc. Tryred lets readers and writers chat with each other but only good vibes are allowed. Readers can discuss with writers. Writers can publish whatever they want but they can be banned if readers will ask for it because good books are most important here. Writers can ask readers for help with writing or they can publish few chapters only and ask readers for feedback because good books are most important here. Everything here is or will be because we all love good books.
