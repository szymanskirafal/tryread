  <h2>Wouldn't it be great to read books for free and pay AFTER you read and whatever you want and only if the book was really good?</h2>
  <p class="py-4">
    Say, you’d like to read something. You don't have much time but you really like to read, you wish you read more, you miss it but... you don’t know what to read, you don't have time to search, you don't want to read anything. You read few reviews and still don’t know which book to buy. You choose one, pay 15 bucks and… it’s not so good but you paid so you read to the end with hope another book will be a bit better. Or you don’t buy any book, you download pirated copies of three books and try them. One is poor, one is so so, but the third one is really good, you read it for few days and you realize you will finish this piracy copy, you don’t like it but you won’t buy a book you’re in the middle of. You may think the author is great so you will buy her another one. You love to read you don’t have nothing to pay the author if the book is really good. In fact you'd like to appreciate the author. This is how Tryread.com works. You don't have to pay but you can. It can be 1 USD, or 5 or 20 if you want. The best of it is the author gets 98 %. Normally, when you pay 15 USD for a book, the author gets only 3 USD. Or less :( If you would pay this 15 USD here, the author gets 14,70 USD. But you don't have to pay 15 USD. You can pay whatever you want and only if you like what you read.

  <h2>Don't let anyone to stay between you and readers.</h2>
  <p class="py-4">There's no reason to let anyone decide whether or when you should publish. There's no reason to let anyone decide if someone can read what you wrote.</p>
  <p>
    I respect every opinion, specially critics, publishers, pro guys. They can help us write better, but I have no ambition to become famous writer, I’m just grateful I can write a story and share. The story is most important, not me. I’m glad the story came to me and I can share it with other. I pray not to break it. If you put it in that way, you won’t find any reason to let anyone decide for you whether to publish or not. You don't even have to wait with publishing to the end of writing. In fact you shouldn't. Publish your first chapter. Share it. Ask readers for opinion. Let them help you with the writing. Let them tell what they like or what you can improve. Don't hide the story. You know how risky it is you will never finish your book without any help or feedback? Do you know how easier writing is when somebody tells you she/he likes it? Do you know how boosting is when people start paying you just for the first 5 or 10 chapters? Let readers help you with the writing. Don’t hide the story. It’s not yours. Yes. The story is not yours. You should just write it. Let it free to the others as soon as possible. The story want to be read by thousands. You doubt? Do you like the story? Do you think it's good, interesting, brings some fun and good emotions or gives entertainment? Do you know how many people would think the same? Do you doubt still? Why? Do you know how many people read? Milions of millions. Do you think there's noone who would think that you the story is fine? You're the only one? Why are you so different? Please. Don’t think about yourself too much. Think it this way. The store has been given to you not to hide but to share it. What you should hide is your fear.
